# Photo Organizer

This project provides a Docker container for organizing a collection of photos using a shell script.

## Description

The `organize_photos.sh` script automates the process of organizing photos within a specified directory by updating metadata, renaming files, removing duplicates, and deleting empty folders. The Docker container is based on Alpine Linux and comes with all the necessary tools installed, such as `exiftool` and `fdupes`.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Docker must be installed on your system to build and run the container.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository or download the `Dockerfile` and `organize_photos.sh` script.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile.

### Executing the program

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t photo-organizer .
```

2. Run the Docker container, making sure to mount the directory containing the photos you wish to organize:

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/photos:/usr/src/photos photo-organizer
```

Replace `/path/to/photos` with the actual path to your photo directory on the host machine.

## Script Actions

The `organize_photos.sh` script performs the following actions:

- Removes cached folders typically generated by photo management software.
- Updates the creation date metadata for WhatsApp photos based on the date in the filename.
- Renames image files based on their original datetime and camera model metadata if available.
- Renames image files based on their original datetime if the camera model is not available.
- Renames image files based on their `CreateDate` metadata if the `datetimeoriginal` is not available.
- Renames image files based on their `ContentCreateDate` metadata if `datetimeoriginal` and `CreateDate` are not available.
- Removes duplicate images.
- Deletes any empty folders in the photo directory.
